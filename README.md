    Memory Game

<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Memory Game is a first project made by myself. After launching the application user can pick board size by clicking one of the radio buttons, then start the game with blue Start Game button. The board with face-down tiles will appear and user should pick two of them. If icons match, they will stay visible. Otherwise, they will disappear after a 1,5s timeout. To win the game user has to uncover every tile. Information about number of moves needed to complete the game is shown upon completion.</h3>
